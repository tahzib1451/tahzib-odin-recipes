    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>If you don't have any leftover cooked rice, here's how to make it: Combine 4 cups water and 2 cups<br>white rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water<br>has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. For the<br>best fried rice results, cover and refrigerate the rice, 8 hours to overnight, before using in this recipe.</p>
